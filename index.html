  <!-- Since no one is going to get this beautiful visual metaphore without explanation...  on the left, the train— that's your content —is coming through an already-made tunnel.  That's the Drupal upgrade process built into Drupal 8 core, which supports upgrades from Drupal 6 and Drupal 7.  On the right, you're stil constructing the tunnel.  That's migrating from any other source.
  It's worth maintaining this distinction in language:  Upgrade is from a recent version of Drupal to Drupal 8, and migration is bringing in content from a non-Drupal database, a CSV or spreadsheet, or flat files.  They use the same underlying technology, migrate module, which is fantastic news for either situation— our tools for both situations are more robust and will keep getting more robust in concert as people deal with edge cases in either situation and commit patches or create contrib modules.
  These are two completely different approaches, and
